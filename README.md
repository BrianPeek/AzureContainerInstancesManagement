# AzureContainerInstancesManagement

Manage Azure Container Instances using Azure Functions. We suppose that there is an external service that manages running instances (Container Groups) and schedules sessions on them.

## Inspiration
This project was heavily inspired by a similar project that deals with VMs called [AzureGameRoomsScaler](https://github.com/PoisonousJohn/AzureGameRoomsScaler).

## One-click deployment

Click the following button to deploy in your Azure subscription:

<a href="https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fdgkanatsios%2FAzureContainerInstancesManagement%2Fmaster%2Fdeploy.json" target="_blank"><img src="http://azuredeploy.net/deploybutton.png"/></a>

*Currently, the deployment fails due to [this](https://github.com/dgkanatsios/AzureContainerInstancesManagement/issues/5) issue. You need to add the Event Subscription webhook manually using the instructions [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-bindings-event-grid#create-a-subscription).*

## Technical details

This project allows you to manage [Azure Container Instances](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/container-instances/) using [Azure Functions](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/functions/). It contains 8 functions:

- **ACICreate**: Creates a new Azure Container Group
- **ACIDelete**: Deletes a Container Group
- **ACIDetails**: Gets details/logs for a Container Group/Container
- **ACIGC**: Runs every 5', removes all Container Groups that have no running sessions and have been marked as 'MarkedForDeletion'
- **ACIList**: Returns the details about 'Running' Container Groups
- **ACIMonitor**: Responds to Event Grid events which occur when a Container Instance resource is created/deleted/changed
- **ACISetSessions**: Sets the running sessions for each Container Group
- **ACISetState**: Sets the state of the Container Group (2 options are 'MarkedForDeletion' and 'Failed')

These functions are supposed to be called by an external service (for a game, this would be the matchmaking service).

Azure Container Groups that are created can be in one of the below states:

- **Creating**: It just has been created
- **Running**: Image pulled, public IP ready, can accept connections
- **MarkedForDeletion**: We can mark a Container Group as `MarkedForDeletion` so that it will be deleted when a) there are no more active sessions and b) the `ACIGC` function runs
- **Failed**: When something has gone bad

## Flow

A typical flow of the app goes like this:

1. External service calls `ACICreate`, so a new Container Group is created and is set to `Creating` state
2. As soon as the Event Grid notification comes to `ACIMonitor` function, this means that the Container Group is ready so the `ACIMonitor` function inserts its public IP into Table Storage
3. External service can call `ACIList` to get Container Groups in `Running` state as well as `ACIDetails` to get logs/details about the Container Group
4. External service or the Docker containers themselves can call `ACISetSessions` to set running sessions count on Table Storage
5. External Service can call `ACISetState` to set Container Groupâ€™s state as `MarkedForDeletion` when the Container Group is no longer needed
6. Time triggered `ACIGC` (GC: Garbage Collector) will remove unwanted Container Groups (i.e. Container Groups that have 0 active/running sesions and are `MarkedForDeletion`)

## FAQ

#### What is this **.deployment** file at the root of the project?
This guides the [Kudu](https://github.com/projectkudu/kudu) engine as to where the source code for the Functions is located, in the GitHub repo. Check [here](https://github.com/projectkudu/kudu/wiki/Customizing-deployments) for details.

#### Why are there 4 ARM templates instead of one?
Indeed, there 4 4 ARM files on the project. They are executed in the following order:
- **deploy.json**: The master template that deploys the other 3
- **deploy.function.json**: Deploys the Azure Function App that contains the Functions of our project
- **deploy.function.config.json**: As we need to set an environment variable that gets the value of our 'ACISetSessions' Function trigger URL, we need to set up this template that executes *after* the deployment of the Azure Function App has completed.
- **deploy.eventgridsubscription.json**: Again, we need to get the Event Grid webhook so we run this *after* the deployment of the Azure Function App has completed.

#### I want to handle more events from Azure Event Grid. Where is the definition of those events?
Check [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-grid/event-schema-resource-groups) for resource group events and [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-grid/event-schema-subscriptions) for subscription-wide events.

#### How can I troubleshoot my Azure Container Instances?
As always, Azure documentation is your friend, check [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-troubleshooting).

#### How can I manage Keys for my Functions?
Check [here](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-host/wiki/Key-management-API).

#### How can I test the Functions?
Not direct Function testing on this project (yet), however you can see a testing file on `tests\index.js`. To run it, you need to setup an `tests\.env` file with the following variables properly set:

- SUBSCRIPTIONID = ''
- CLIENTID = ''
- CLIENTSECRET = ''
- TENANT = ''
- AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT = ''
- AZURE_STORAGE_ACCESS_KEY = ''

## Demo
We have created a Docker image of the popular game open source game [Teeworlds](https://www.teeworlds.com/) that can be used to demonstrate this project. Here are the steps that you could use if you wanted to set up a quick demo of the project:
- Deploy the project (you can use one-click deployment, as described in the beginning).
- Deploy the Event Grid subscription. You can either deploy the [deploy.eventgridsubscription.json](deploy.eventgridsubscription.json) file or use Azure portal or CLI ([instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-bindings-event-grid#create-a-subscription)). When you deploy, make sure that you're monitoring for **all** events either the Resource Group you're planning to create your Container Instances on or your entire subscription.
- Call the ACICreate Function to create an Azure Container Instance with the dgkanatsios/docker-teeworlds image. You can get Function's key from the Azure Portal ([instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-create-first-azure-function#test-the-function)) and use the provided [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) file (located [here](various/ACIManagement.postman_collection.json)) to begin. POST body should be similar to (yeah, half a GB memory/CPU is more than enough):
```javascript
{
    "resourceGroup": "teeworlds",
    "containerGroupName": "teeserver1",
    "containerGroup" : {
        "location": "westeurope",
        "containers": [{
            "name": "teeserver1",
            "image": "dgkanatsios/docker-teeworlds", 
            "environmentVariables": [{
                "name":"SERVER_NAME",
                "value":"Azure-Dimitris-1"
            }],
            "resources": {
                "requests": {
                    "memoryInGB": 0.5,
                    "cpu": 0.5
                }
            },
            "ports": [{
                "protocol": "udp",
                "port": 8303
            }]
        }],
        "ipAddress": {
            "ports": [{
                "protocol": "udp",
                "port": 8303
            }],
            "type": "Public"
        },
        "osType": "Linux"
    }
}
```
- Once it's deployed, you will see an entry in your Azure Table. You can use [Azure Storage Explorer](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/features/storage-explorer/) to monitor it. If Event Grid integration works, your instance should be in the **Running** stage, having a Public IP.
- Call the ACIList Function to see your **Running** Container Instances. Get its IP, and try to connect to it using [Teeworlds client](https://www.teeworlds.com/?page=downloads). Hopefully this works, you have successfully set up your Teeworlds game server on Azure!
