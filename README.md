## FAQ

#### What is this **.deployment** file at the root of the project?
This guides the [Kudu](https://github.com/projectkudu/kudu) engine as to where the source code for the Functions is located, in the GitHub repo. Check [here](https://github.com/projectkudu/kudu/wiki/Customizing-deployments) for details.

#### Why are there 4 ARM templates instead of one?
Indeed, there 4 4 ARM files on the project. They are executed in the following order:
- **deploy.json**: The master template that deploys the other 3
- **deploy.function.json**: Deploys the Azure Function App that contains the Functions of our project
- **deploy.function.config.json**: As we need to set an environment variable that gets the value of our 'ACIReportSessions' Function trigger URL, we need to set up this template that executes *after* the deployment of the Azure Function App has completed.
- **deploy.eventgridsubscription.json**: Again, we need to get the Event Grid webhook so we run this *after* the deployment of the Azure Function App has completed.

#### I want to handle more events from Azure Event Grid. Where is the definition of those events?
Check [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-grid/event-schema-resource-groups) for resource group events and [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-grid/event-schema-subscriptions) for subscription-wide events.

#### How can I troubleshoot my Azure Container Instances?
As always, Azure documentation is your friend, check [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-troubleshooting).

#### How can I test the Functions?
Not direct Function testing on this project (yet), however you can see a testing file on `tests\index.js`. To run it, you need to setup an `tests\.env` file with the following variables properly set:

- SUBSCRIPTIONID = ''
- CLIENTID = ''
- CLIENTSECRET = ''
- TENANT = ''
- AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT = ''
- AZURE_STORAGE_ACCESS_KEY = ''
